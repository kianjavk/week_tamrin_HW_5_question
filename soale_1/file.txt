I think among specialists, the most overblown concern is pleiotropy.
The modal geneticist probably tends to overestimate the amount of pleiotropy in the genome.
Often they don't really have good intuitions for high dimensional spaces,
or they were told in a textbook that pleiotropy is significant.
But all of our empirical tests show that pleiotropy is not that strong,
so you can have big gains which are pretty safe,
or you can boost one trait without necessarily screwing up something else.
